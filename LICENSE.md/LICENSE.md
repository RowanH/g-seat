Here’s my approach and intent:

* I don’t have any intention of selling it but I may in future help supply any of the difficult parts to source (e.g. the bracket).
* if/when it’s all working and someone uses the designs, and wants to buy me a few of my favourite Garage Project beers, or some new hex wrenches etc I wouldn’t be sad ! Please don’t ask to donate money, that would be weird, just find a tool off my garage wish list and surprise me ! (I’m going to find something locally instead of this, since covid, world shipping has gone ballistic $ wise and well yeah might have to go back to a paypal donation or something) https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3V5DZTPQPXZKQ?ref_=wl_share
* I also don’t want people verbatim copying it and passing it off as their own.
* I want people to be able to share, improve, build upon – regardless of what they want to do with it and in doing so contribute their improvements back to the community. (say hello to the true ethos of Open Source).
* You’d have to be brain dead to commercially try anything round this- the risk for injury is way to high. I won’t prevent it from a license standpoint but you’d have to be insane to try selling one or a derivative of. One set of broken ribs later or squished fingers and you’d be in trouble. 
* This is all at your own risk if you choose to embark on building one 

Thus:

In Summary

Basically you can use this information in any way you choose including in commercial products, but you must :
(a) attribute my design (eg. “Using @steely’s G-Seat”, or “Modified version of @steely’s G-Seat”) and
(b) if you modify, build upon it – you must release any derivative works with the same conditions and clearly attribute “@Steely’s G-Seat”. Regardless of whether for DIY purposes or you want to build something commercially.

Seems fair to me and allows everyone to build upon and iterate it.

Go nuts folks. Go nuts.

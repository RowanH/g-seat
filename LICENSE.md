In Summary

Basically you can use this information in any way you choose including in commercial products, but you must :
(a) attribute my design (eg. “Using @steely’s G-Seat”, or “Modified version of @steely’s G-Seat”) and
(b) if you modify, build upon it – you must release any derivative works with the same conditions and clearly attribute “@Steely’s G-Seat”. Regardless of whether for DIY purposes or you want to build something commercially.

Seems fair to me and allows everyone to build upon and iterate it.

Go nuts folks. Go nuts.

## How do I build it 
There will be actual build guides when I've cleaned all the files up and have a bit more time. At this point you really need to know what you're doing so I'm actually being suitably light on detail to ensure there's a bit of a bar to meet. 

I really, really, don't want anyone thinking this is going to be a cakewalk - or is absolutely 100% proven, going off and building one, then having issues and be sad - then blame me because they feel like they've lit $3000-4500NZD on fire. So here's the obligatory No Warranties given (refer to license here : https://www.rowanhick.com/2020/03/05/steelys-g-seat-copyright-open-source-license) 


## Caution 
This is the ALPHA release of files, there was still quite a lot of manual work (and still some to go) to get them working on my rig.
This is not intended to be a ready to go DIY kit. Please check the issues log and make sure you've joined my discord so you're 
fully prepared before embarking on build one of these. It's a lot of money to get it wrong. This has only beent tested for someone 6ft high, 75kg. Anatomy will play a big part how much you need to modify the design. 

## The other Caution  
This could hurt you, remove a finger, or cause you a nasty electric shock. You've been warned.

The license is extremely permissive, it's main requirements are that (a) you've got to include the same license in any derivative design (b) that you also have to share your derivative design(s) and (c) you've got to attribute (Credit) my original design. Simple.

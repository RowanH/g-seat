## What is this about ?

Please refer to https://www.rowanhick.com/motion-simulator

## How do I build it 
There will be actual build guides when I've cleaned all the files up and have a bit more time. At this point you really need to know what you're doing so I'm intentionally setting a "barrier for entry" by being suitably light on detail.

Review my blog articles up above in particular this one :

## Setting expectations
I really, really, don't want anyone thinking this is going to be a cakewalk - or is absolutely 100% proven, going off and building one, then having issues - and blame me because they feel like they've lit $3000-4500NZD on fire. There's a lot of dollars in components and so far only I've built one. I've documented what I know to date the issues are here https://github.com/RowanH/g-seat/issues

## Caution 
This is the ALPHA release of files, there was still quite a lot of manual work from these files to getting them working in my rig (it wasn't a straight bolt on exercise).
This is not intended to be a ready to go DIY kit. Please check the issues log and make sure you've joined my discord so you're 
fully prepared before embarking on build one of these. It's a lot of money to get it wrong. This has only been tested for someone 6ft high, 75kg. Anatomy will play a big part how much you need to modify the design. 

## The other Caution  
This could hurt you, remove a finger, or cause you a nasty electric shock. You've been warned.

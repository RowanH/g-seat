# @steely's G-Seat

## What is this about ?
![G-Seat Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RowanH/g-seat/alpha/aluminium-panels/IsoView.JPG)
Please refer to https://www.rowanhick.com/motion-simulator

A DIY Open source design for a high performance 'G-Seat' that provides motion cueing for simulators. Turn left and the right hand panels push against you, accelerate and both back panels push against you. 

Comprised of 8 folded aluminium brackets + panels, mechanical components and 4 AC Servos 

Needs motion control software + controllers to work - I use and recommend SimFeedback https://opensfx.com 

## How do I build it 
There will be actual build guides when I've cleaned all the files up and have a bit more time. At this point you really need to know what you're doing so I'm intentionally setting a "barrier for entry" by being suitably light on detail.

Review my blog articles up above in particular this one :

## Setting expectations
I really, really, don't want anyone thinking this is going to be a cakewalk - or is absolutely 100% proven, going off and building one, then having issues - and blame me because they feel like they've lit $4000-5000NZD on fire. There's a lot of dollars in components and so far only I've built one. I've documented what I know to date the issues are here https://github.com/RowanH/g-seat/issues

No warranties are given express or implied. (refer to license here : https://www.rowanhick.com/2020/03/05/steelys-g-seat-copyright-open-source-license) 


## Caution 
This is the ALPHA release of files, there was still quite a lot of manual work from these files to getting them working in my rig (it wasn't a straight bolt on exercise).
This is not intended to be a ready to go DIY kit. Please check the issues log and make sure you've joined my discord https://discord.gg/ZVkz2tC so you're 
fully prepared before embarking on build one of these. It's a lot of money to get it wrong. This has only been tested for someone 6ft high, 75kg. Anatomy will play a big part how much you need to modify the design. 

## The other Caution  
This could hurt you, remove a finger, or cause you a nasty electric shock. You've been warned.

And refer to the full version of license wording here https://github.com/RowanH/g-seat/blob/alpha/LICENSE.md

The license is extremely permissive, it's main requirements are that (a) you've got to include the same license in any derivative design (b) that you also have to share your derivative design(s) and (c) you've got to attribute (Credit) my original design regardless of where you use it. Simple. 

### Attribution 

You must say "@Steely's G-Seat" and include a link to https://www.rowanhick.com/motion-simulator that's an express requirement of the license. 

So for instance if you were to sell this commercially (brave, brave person) on your product page you must say 

.... your product copy .... "uses @Steely's G-Seat design https://www.rowanhick.com/motion-simulator" 

You *can't* pass this off as your own design without credit. You also must include the license verbatim.  

### Derivative works 

If you modify the design in any form you *must* include this same license and you *must* provide open source files. 

So you can't take the design, tweak something, call it your own and not provide files.

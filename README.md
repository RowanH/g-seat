# @steely's G-Seat

Please refer to https://www.rowanhick.com/motion-simulator

This is the ALPHA release of files, there was still quite a lot of work (and still some to go) to get them working on my rig. 
This is not intended to be a ready to go DIY kit. Please check the issues log and make sure you've joined my discord so you're 
fully prepared before embarking on build one of these. It's a lot of money to get it wrong.
